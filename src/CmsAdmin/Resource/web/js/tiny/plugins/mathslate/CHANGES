Version 1.1

This release adds to the original 1.0 version some technical improvements.

    1. The editor now supports MathJax Output modes NativeMML and SVG
    in addittion to HTML-CSS.  It will use the current output jax to
    display all mathematics.

    2. The TeX tool now has a more robust XML parser so that it should be
    able to convert any TeX expression supported by the MathJax
    configuration to work within the editor.

    3. JSON to MathML conversions has be improved to provide more complete
    MathML configuration of editor.

    4. The default configuration has been updated slightly to utilize
    some of the improvements.

    5. Some improvements have been made in the API to make it more easily 
    used in other plugins.
